# 100 Days of ML Code Challenge - Log

## Day 1

Starting from here [YouTube Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuQMBj1cWPo&t=7s)

Watched several Siraj vidoes on YouTube.

Signed up for
[Machine Learning with a Heart](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/54/machine-learning-with-a-heart/)
on [Driven Data](www.drivendata.org)

When I joined the competition and looked at the leaderboard, there were no entries, and absolutely anything I 
submitted would make the me leader.  So I decided to make an effort to upload something, however
minimal and become the leader.  Yippee!

I chose this because it was small, then download it and the training data set had only 180 items.  Nevertheless it took me
several tries to process the data into the right formats, and several tries to upload a valid submission.  So it turns out
to be a very good place to start.
