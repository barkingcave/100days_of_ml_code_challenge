# 100 Days of ML Code Challenge - Log

## Day 1

Starting from here [YouTube Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuQMBj1cWPo&t=7s)

Watched several Siraj vidoes on YouTube.

When I joined the competition and looked at the leaderboard, there were no entries, and absolutely anything I 
submitted would make the me leader.  So I decided to make an effort to upload something, however
minimal and become the leader.

I chose this because it was small.   The training data set had only 180 items.  Nevertheless it took me
several tries to process the data into the right formats, and several tries to upload a valid submission.  So it turns out
to be a very good place to start.

# Day 2

My day of glory as #1 on the leaderboard is over.    My solution didn't even beat the linear regression bot (?) solution.
I used a keras sequential model. Since there is so little data, it is no surprise that would not be the best solution.

Today, I implemented an Support Vector solution.  Again, the bulk of time involved getting the training and testing data 
into the right formats.   I did no tuning, but still my SVM solution beat the linear regression model.  Another user is now at number #1, but I'm #2 for now.    

I'm going to take the data camp course on Support Vector Machines and refine this 
solution, but will leave that for Day 3.

I also listened to an episode or two of "Machine Learning Guide" podcast.
